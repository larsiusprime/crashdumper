crashdumper
===========

A cross-platform automated crash report generator/sender for Haxe/OpenFL apps.

Setup
===========

  1. Install crashdumper (coming soon to haxelib, just github for now).
     
     Command Line:
     ````
     haxelib git crashdumper https://github.com/McJonnycat/crashdumper
     ````
  2. Include crashdumper in your project.xml:  
     
     ````xml
     <haxelib name="crashdumper"/>
     ````
  3. Optionally, set one or both of these haxedefs in your project.xml (for cpp targets)  
     
     ````xml
     <haxedef name="HXCPP_STACK_LINE" />  <!--if you want line numbers-->
	 <haxedef name="HXCPP_STACK_TRACE"/>  <!--if you want stack traces-->
     ````
     On flash target, stack traces will only be generated in a debug player.


If you don't set the haxedefs, you'll still get a crashdump with a system profile, error message and some other useful info, but you won't get line numbers and a backtrace of the method call stack that led up to the error.


Usage
===========

    var unique_id:String = SessionData.generateID("fooApp_"); 
        //generates unique id: "fooApp_YYYY-MM-DD_HH'MM'SS_CRASH"
        
    var crashDumper = new CrashDumper(unique_id); 
        //starts the crashDumper
        
(An example app is provided in the /Example folder)

It will generate something like this:

    SystemData
    {
      OS : Windows 7 SP1
      RAM: 8387064 KB (8 GB)
      CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E7400  @ 2.80GHz
      GPU: ATI Radeon HD 4800 Series, driver v. 8.970.100.1100
    }
    --------------------------------------
    filename:	Example
    package:	crashdumper.example
    version:	1.0.0
    session ID:	example_app_2014-06-02_15'38'19
    started:	2014-06-02 15:38:19
    --------------------------------------
    crashed:	2014-06-02 15:38:21
    error:		Null Object Reference
    stack:
    *._Function_1_1 (openfl/display/Stage.hx line 120)
    Main.onClick (Main.hx line 55)
    openfl.events.Listener.dispatchEvent (openfl/events/EventDispatcher.hx line 268)
    openfl.events.EventDispatcher.dispatchEvent (openfl/events/EventDispatcher.hx line 98)

    openfl.display.DisplayObject.__fireEvent (openfl/display/DisplayObject.hx line 256)
    openfl.display.Stage.__onMouse (openfl/display/Stage.hx line 902)

You may optionally also cache data files (such as a user/player's save game data and/or application config data) at that moment, and the crash report will include verbatim copies of those save files. You can use this to generate a crash report that includes as much data as possible about the user's starting conditions.

Server-Side
============

CrashDumper can be hooked up to a server-side listener that process and/or stores crash dumps. We are happy to receive any such implementations as pull requests, [you can find them all here](https://github.com/larsiusprime/crashdumper/tree/master/servers).

We specifically recommend **[Crashdump Browser](https://github.com/larsiusprime/crashdumper/tree/master/servers/crashdumpbrowser)**.

Paths
============

By default will write to your program's application storage directory (`SystemPath.applicationStorageDirectory`), under `/logs/errors/<SESSION_ID>`.
You can supply your own path, of course.

Performance
============

Using crashdumper probably comes with a small hit to performance, but it should be much less than the difference between debug and release mode. 

`HXCPP_STACK_TRACE` and `HXCPP_STACK_LINE` both come with a small hit to performance, but if you're worried about optimization, `LINE` is the most expensive, `TRACE` is relatively cheap.

We still need to run performance tests to see what the actual overheads are. We would be more than happy to welcome your benchmark results with crashdumper!
