crashdumper
===========

A cross-platform automated crash report generator/sender for Haxe/OpenFL apps.

Setup
===========

  1. Install crashdumper (coming soon to haxelib, just github for now).
     
     Command Line:
     ````
     haxelib git crashdumper http://github.com/larsiusprime/crashdumper
     ````
  2. Include crashdumper in your project.xml:  
     
     ````
     <haxelib name="crashdumper"/>
     ````
  3. Optionally, set one or both of these haxedefs in your project.xml (for cpp targets)  
     
     ````
     <haxedef name="HXCPP_STACK_LINE" />  <!--if you want line numbers-->
	 <haxedef name="HXCPP_STACK_TRACE"/>  <!--if you want stack traces-->
     ````

If you don't set the haxedefs, you'll still get a crashdump with a system profile, error message and some other useful info, but you won't get line numbers and a backtrace of the method call stack that led up to the error.


Usage
===========

    var unique_id:String = SessionData.generateID("fooApp_"); 
        //generates unique id: "fooApp_YYYY-MM-DD_HH'MM'SS_CRASH"
        
    var crashDumper = new CrashDumper(unique_id); 
        //starts the crashDumper
        
(An example app is provided in the /Example folder)

It will generate something like this:

    SystemData
    {
      OS : Windows 7 SP1
      RAM: 8387064 KB (8 GB)
      CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     E7400  @ 2.80GHz
      GPU: ATI Radeon HD 4800 Series, driver v. 8.970.100.1100
    }

    filename:	Example
    package:	crashdumper.example
    version:	1.0.0

    crashed:	2014-06-02 15:38:21
    error:		Null Object Reference
    stack:

    openfl.display.DisplayObject.__fireEvent (openfl/display/DisplayObject.hx line 256)
    openfl.display.Stage.__onMouse (openfl/display/Stage.hx line 902)

You may optionally also cache data files (such as a user/player's save game data and/or application config data) at that moment, and the crash report will include verbatim copies of those save files. You can use this to generate a crash report that includes as much data as possible about the user's starting conditions.

Paths
============

By default will write to your program's own directory, under /logs/errors/\<SESSION_ID\>
You can supply your own path, of course.

Performance
============

Using crashdumper probably comes with a small hit to performance, but it should be much less than the difference between debug and release mode. 

HXCPP_STACK_TRACE and HXCPP_STACK_LINE both come with a small hit to performance, but if you're worried about optimization, LINE is the most expensive, TRACE is relatively cheap.

We still need to run performance tests to see what the actual overheads are. We would be more than happy to welcome your benchmark results with crashdumper!

System profiles
============

Here's some examples of the output created by CrashDumper for different systems:

    }

TODO
=============

 - SystemData processing for Mac & ~~Linux~~ (pull requests welcome!)
 - Ability to zip up crash reports
 - Ability to email crash reports to the developer or send to a web server
 - Ability to store custom data (such as HaxeFlixel replays) for super advanced crash reporting.
